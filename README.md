# Discord_Bot_Management_Rest_Api

## Prerequisite

You'll need to gather two important datas before launching the API :
    - the *chat id* where you want you bot to be talking.
    - a token designating your bot. You can get that token on the bot management discord page.
  
Now that you have those 2 things, you need to create a json file named token_discord_bot_<n>.json (where n is the number of your bot for example 1 2 3...)
the json file should be as follows : 

    {"token":"<yourtoken>","salon_id":"<your chat id>"}
